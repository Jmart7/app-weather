## Comments

<ul>
    <li>The .env from the backend is included in order to facilitate testing the application. In a real world app, the .env file won't be commited as i did.</li>
    <li>I tried asking but got no response so i made the decision to instead of getting the day and night time, i show the min and max temperature of a day. This decision was made because the api doesn't provide such field in the json i got as the response.</li>
    <li>Also i created a private git repository but no username was given to me so i can't give access to it, that's why i'm giving the zip instead.</li>
</ul>
