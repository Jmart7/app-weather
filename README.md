## Instructions to Install and run

### Linux

Run `docker-compose up --build`

### Windows

As i didn't setup the docker on windows, i'll explain how to run it withoud it

Run `npm install` on both Frontend and Backend folders.
After that you can do `npm run start` on both folders too.

### Comments

You should use your own .env on the Backend folder as it requires an apiKey and an apiUrl.

The apiUrl is : `https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/forecast/daily?`

As for the apiKey you should go to the page mentioned above, sign up and ask for the key.
